            Using this science, we can explain a lot of phenomenon in the competitive programming world:Some guys learn very fast, got to div 1 in Topcoder/Codeforces only after like a couple of weeks since he started programming. Some people are born with high jumping ability (problem solving skill). They can jump over average gaps easily.
            The more you train, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> better you become: Of course, if you jump around all day, you must be somewhat better at jumping through gaps, and thus being able to solve more difficult problems in less time, since you don't need lots of mental preparation or warm up excercise before jumping.
            But.. it also means that, if you just solve too easy problems, you can still only walk through small gaps. You may walk through gaps faster, but you are still unable to jump.
            So yes, the best strategy to improve your competitive programming skill is to practice a lot, but you must solve gradually harder problems, not just the easy ones. Get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself. For example, if you solve problems on Codeforces:
            Sort by number of people who solved it.
            Continue until you feel challenged (e.g. need like an hour to solve / can not solve at all / ...).
            Try really hard, but if you fail, look at editorial, ask for solutions, ...better you become: Of course, if you jump around all day, you must be somewhat better at jumping through gaps, and thus being able to solve more difficult problems in less time, since you don't need lots of mental preparation or warm up excercise before jumping.
